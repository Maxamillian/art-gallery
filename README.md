Art Gallery
An app that displays a user's art for others to browse.

This app will display an artists art so that they can be viewed by others. Viewers of the site can "like" their favorite images. Liked images will be displayed in a separate view.

Artists want to share their art, and their fans or clients want to be able to view the art, but don't have a way to do so easily.

Art Gallery benefits the artist because it allows him or her to display their art to the world. Users of the site are then able to easily view art and keep track of their favorites.

"Art is meant to be shared. This app makes doing so easy!"

The main page displays all the art. All you have to do is click on the images expand them.

"I love this app! I am able to keep track of all my favorite art! There is absolutely NOTHING like this anywhere on the internet! So very very happy!"

After you have browsed the collection, click on the link up top to create an account and login. Then you can like images. Now you can go to your favorites page and view all the images you liked.
